# instructions for the speech recognition

First of all: You need Chrome!
Second: For each recognition you need to reload the website!

1. Open the following link on Chrome: https://dennisbu.octans.uberspace.de/audio
2. Open the console within Chrome by pressing "ctrl + shift + i" on Windows or "cmd + shift + i" on Mac and click on the tab "Console".
3. Reload the page.
4. The speech recognition is starting the moment you start to speak (or someone around you). You can see this in the console: "recording..."
5. The system recognizes when you end: "Record stopped."
6. After that you will get a transcript of what you said in the console.
7. If your speech contained one of the word patterns the system will give you a message.

Word patterns included:
- "love"
- "hate"

There is an API-Template available for Processing. See the specific PDE for more.
